Candor CMS
==========

A simple CMS system written in Clojure.

It's still in the concept phase, these are the features I want:

File-based
----------

There will be no data base, everything will be stored in files that
can be conveniently edited with a text editor or managed by a version
control system.

Web interface
-------------

The full functionality of the CMS system will be availble through a
simple web interface.

Template language
-----------------

There will be a template language in the spirit of Radius from
[Radiant CMS](http://radiantcms.org/).

Plugins
-------

It will be possible to extend Candor CMS with additional functionality
by writing Clojure scripts.
